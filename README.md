# LightHUD

"My" personal HUD aimed to be very minimal and light on performance, get's rid of many elements I don't personally feel the need of and with that brings a bit more stability with less freezes and some extra FPS.

This is mainly made of other HUD's this is mostly just LightHUD and DarHUD combined and with some elements i plan to add like the Aachievements and training, etc...

Here are some of the screenshots, full album [HERE](../screenshots/showcase.md) 

NOTE: My fork doesn't have screenshots yet so the screenshots will just be the vanilla LightHUD
